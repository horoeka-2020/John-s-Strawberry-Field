We suggest buying an grafted avocado tree from a garden centre, as seed grown avocados are unreliable and will take a long time to produce fruit. Make sure that the tree is healthy, and the graft has healed. Like building a house a good foundation is the key to success in your garden. The better the soil, the better your plants will grow. Avocados prefer sandy, well-drained soil.',

Blueberries can be planted year-round. The better the soil, the better your berries will grow. Blueberries prefer a free draining, more acidic soil with a high proportion of organic matter. They are best planted in a sheltered, well drained position in full sun. ',

Their fruit, however, is thin-skinned and small in size, which makes them more susceptible to cold damage than the larger orange and grapefruit. Mandarins grow better when the weather is hot and humid. The trees need protection from frost. Like building a house a good foundation is the key to success in your garden. The better the soil, the better your plants will grow. If you are starting with an existing garden bed dig in organic matter like Tui Sheep Pellets and Tui Compost to your soil. Then you can add a layer of Tui Garden Mix',

      planting: 'Nothing quite says spring has arrived like Daffodil’s do. These well-known garden treasures come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, colours and types. The days of only bright yellow Daffodils being available are gone; now you can find numerous shades of white, orange, lemon, cream and ivory. There is bound to be a Daffodil to suit most gardens, and they’re almost fool proof. Ideal for picking for the vase as they last for over a week. Growing Daffodil’s is easy, generally all they need is a good, fertile, free-draining soil and plenty of sun. Choose a well-drained site for your Daffodil’s as they loathe wet feet. They thrive in pots & containers too, so you have lots of options about where you can place and plant your bulbs. Daffodils need plenty of sun to flower, but will flower well if planted under deciduous trees, as the sunlight will be able to get through the branches when the tree has no leaves.',
